Contents Description: (see more details in file header)
=====================
The file contains means of several variables from an ECHAM5 palaeoclimate simulation. Details about the simulation are given in the file name and file header. For information about the simulation setup and boundary conditions, we refer the user to the associated publication. 

Variables included in data package p000:
- aprl: large scale precipitation
- aprc: convective precipitation
- temp2: 2m air temperature
- u10: zonal near surface wind speeds
- v10: meridional near surface wind speeds

Variables included in data package p001:
- aprl: large scale precipitation
- aprc: convective precipitation
- aprt: total precipitation (large scale and convective)
- temp2: 2m air temperature
- tsurf: surface temperature
- srads: net surface solar radiation
- ahfl: latent heat flux
- evap: evaporation
- pe: potential evaporation
- q: specific humidity
- ws: soil wetness
- drain: drainage
- runoff: surface runoff and drainage
- u10: zonal near surface wind speeds
- v10: meridional near surface wind speeds
